  - title: About Me
    description:
      - User-focused software developer and former intelligence analyst. JavaScript is my favorite language as a developer, but am also comfortable with Ruby and more specialized languages like Stata. I hope to work on web-based projects that prioritize use accesibility and experience.
      - Having studied Economics and Japanese Language in college, I have a lot of expereince with both numerical and linguistic analysis. My time as an all-source analyst for the Army further cemented my research skills, and gave me practice conveying the results of my research to others in a professional setting. Studying web development at Turing has helped me to synthesize these skills--analytics, research, and presentation--into a solid techinal skillset that has built the foundation of my future growth as a developer.
      - As I continue my journey into the tech industry, I am continually looking to build my network; Please feel free to send me an email or a request on LinkedIn if you'd like to connect! (Mouse over the icons next to my profile image to see more contact info.)
